# Report Tweaks - Redcap External Module

More complete end-user facing documentation can be found [here](https://aanunez.io/docs/report-tweaks/)

## What does it do?

Report tweaks adds options to hide redcap generated columns, merge rows from the same record, hide empty rows, and add "writeback" buttons to reports that allow for flags or action dates to be set on all records in a report and more. See the above documentation for more details. Configuration is done on the edit report screen under a new "Report Tweaks" section, no additional user rights are needed. Some settings can also be toggled on the report itself.

## Installing

You can install the module from the REDCap EM repo or drop it directly in your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/report_tweaks_v1.0.0`).
